# Mask-Temp-Detection-Device-Based-on-Raspberry-Pi-Python-OpenCV-tfLite
This system is to detect mask and temperature for COVID-19 Precautions with 99% accuracy, based on Python and OpenCV. I have used TensorFlow to train the model for mask detection and then converted the model into tflite for Raspberry Pi implementation. 
Pi Camera is used for mask detection.
Contactless Infrared Temperature Sensor MLX90614 is used for temperature detection.
The system is 12V operated.
